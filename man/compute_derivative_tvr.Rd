\title{Total Variation Regularized Differentiation}
\usage{
compute_derivative_tvr(Z, t = NULL, lambda = "auto", solver = "osqp", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{Numeric vector of observations.}

\item{t}{Numeric vector of time points (NULL assumes dt=1).}

\item{lambda}{Regularization parameter ("auto" for cross-validation selection).}

\item{solver}{Optimization backend: "osqp", "ecos", or "scs".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (ignored).}
}
\value{
Object of class "tvr_derivative" (also a list with $derivative).
}
\description{
Computes derivatives by solving a convex optimization problem that balances
fidelity to the data against smoothness of the derivative.
